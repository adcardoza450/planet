    "# Analysis Ready Data Tutorial Part 2: Use Case 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-series analysis (e.g. change detection and trend detection) is a powerful application of satellite imagery. However, a great deal of processing is required to prepare imagery for analysis. Analysis Ready Data (ARD), preprocessed time-series stacks of overhead imagery, allow for time-series analysis without any additional processing of the imagery. See [Analysis Data Defined](https://medium.com/planet-stories/analysis-ready-data-defined-5694f6f48815) for an excellent introduction and discussion on ARD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 1](ard_1_intro_and_best_practices.ipynb) of this tutorial, we introduced ARD and covered the how and whys of using the Data and Orders APIs to create and interpret ARD.\n",
    "\n",
    "This second part of the tutorial focuses on the first of two use cases. The use case addressed in this tutorial is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a software engineer at an ag-tech company, I'd like to be able to order Planet imagery programmatically in a way that enables the data scientist at my organization to create time-series algorithms (e.g. monitoring ndvi curves over time) without further data cleaning and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the first part of the tutorial for an introduction to the Data and Orders APIs along with best practices. A lot of functionality developed in that tutorial will be copied here in a compact form.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things are interesting about this use case. First, we are calculating NDVI, and second, we are compositing scenes together. What is NDVI and what is compositing and why do we want to do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Great questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, NDVI stands for normalized difference vegitation index. It is used a **LOT** to find out if vegetation is growing. You can find out more about NDVI at [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/eros/phenology/science/ndvi-foundation-remote-sensing-phenology?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index). What we care about here is that NDVI uses the red and near-infrared bands of an image and returns one band with values that range from -1 to 1. So, we expect a single-band image for each order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compositing is a way to stitch multiple scenes together for maximum coverage. We want this because for a time series, we just want one image for each date and we want that one image to have the most coverage to minimize holes in our data. The composite tool takes in multiple scenes and returns one image. If we feed it scenes from a whole timestack, we still just get one image back! So, to avoid that disaster, we group our scenes by date and only composite the scenes that were collected on the same date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The use case we will cover is: *As a software engineer at an ag-tech company, I'd like to be able to order Planet imagery programmatically in a way that enables the data scientist at my organization to create time-series algorithms (e.g. monitoring ndvi curves over time) without further data cleaning and processing.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this use case, the area of interest and time range are not specified. The need for no further processing indicates we should specify a strict usable pixel data filter. For time-series analysis the daily coverage of PS satellites is ideal. For our time-series analysis, we would like a single image that covers the entire area of interest (AOI). However, it may take multiple scenes to cover the entire AOI. Therefore, we will use the Composite tool to make a composite for each day in the time series analysis. This is a little tricky because the Composite tool just composites all of the scenes associated with the ids ordered. So we need to parse the scene ids we got from the Data API to get scene ids for each day, then submit an order for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, these are the steps:\n",
    "1. [Initialize API client](#Step-1:-Initialize-API-client)\n",
    "1. [Search Data API](#Step-2:-Search-Data-API)\n",
    "1. [Group IDs by Date](#Step-3:-Group-IDs-by-Date)\n",
    "1. [Submit Orders](#Step-4:-Submit-Orders)\n",
    "1. [Download Orders](#Step-5:-Download-Orders)\n",
    "1. [Unzip and Verify Orders](#Step-6:-Unzip-and-Verify-Orders)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, due to the processing-intensiveness of visualizing the NDVI images and UDM2s, we will be covering visualization in the next notebook, [Analysis Ready Data Tutorial Part 2: Use Case 1 - Visualization](ard_2_use_case_1_visualize_images.ipynb)\n",

    "In the explorer, navigate to the data folder (should be `*/notebooks/analysis-ready-data/data/use_case_1/`). In any of the subfolders (named with the `order_id`), go into `files` and find the file named `composite.tif`). Drag that file into QGIS to visualize."
